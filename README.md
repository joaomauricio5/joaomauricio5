- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m JoÃ£o MaurÃ­cio!

- I'm an Audio and Music Technology graduate who discovered a passion for programming through my degree and I'm now working towards becoming a Software Developer. 

- Currently focusing on **iOS Development** with SwiftUI through Codecademy's [iOS Developer Career Path](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/ios-developer) and Apple's [iOS App Dev Tutorials](https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/app-dev-training).


- Also participating in the [#100DaysOfCode](https://www.100daysofcode.com/) Challenge for the first time! See my progress [here](https://github.com/joaomauricio5/100-days-of-code/blob/master/log.md).
